## Description
Friend Table is a demonstration of some features of React.  Using an internal database (currently not changeable), Friend Table allows you to sort and filter on First Name, Last Name, Gender, City and Country.  It also allows sorting by ID.  To sort, simply click the colum you wish to sort.  The first click sorts in ascending order.  The second click sorts in descending order.  Leveraging an aggregated filter field, filtering happens immediately with any charactes you type into the "Filter text" input.  This is homework 19 from the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp.

## Installation
Optionally fork, and clone the repo to your system.  Ensure Node.js and NPM are installed.  Once cloned, run "npm install" to install all dependendent packages.   

## Usage
Run `npm start` in the applications main directory.  This will start the application on port 3000 (can be changed in code).  By default, your system should launch a browser but you can also access via http://localhost:3000 or http://(server-ip-address):3000 on your network.
